# Implementation of a Decentralized Road Traffic Congestion Avoidance Mechanism for VANETs
## Abstract
Simulation remains the preferred option for testing new approaches in relation to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) research. This is no different when it comes to road traffic congestion avoidance mechanisms that utilize VANETs. There are several examples of VANET-based approaches to road traffic congestion avoidance that are tested using simulations in the literature. Notwithstanding, the replicability and extensibility of many approaches are limited due to the fact that their implementations are not publicly available. In this work, based on prior work, a decentralized mechanism is designed and implemented to perform road traffic congestion avoidance in VANETs. Evaluation results show that due to vehicles having longer trip times, vehicular density in the road network can be up to 2.5 times higher in scenarios where the road traffic congestion avoidance mechanism is not in use. Unlike prior work, we make the implementation publicly-available to enhance its replicability and extensibility.
